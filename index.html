                <h2 id="section1">Conditions All Round The World</h2>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome. The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, and attempts to contain it there failed, allowing it to spread across the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 28 January 2022, the pandemic had caused more than 366 million cases and 5.63 million deaths, making it one of the deadliest in history.</p>

                <h2 id="Covid-19Vaccination"> Covid-19 Vaccination </h2>
                <p>The vaccine reduces your risk of infection.
                    Once you receive your first shot, your body begins producing antibodies to the coronavirus. These antibodies help your immune system fight the virus if you happen to be exposed, so it reduces your chance of getting the disease.The vaccine protects against severe illness.
                    During studies, the three vaccines â€” Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer â€” have shown to be effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19. So if you are vaccinated and become infected, you are very unlikely to become severely ill.</p>
